Hi!  I'm a developer in Lincoln, Nebraska, attempting to learn about the world of web development.  I've been an iOS developer for 3 years but I've spent the last year learning React and Javascript for a mobile product.  I hope to learn more about Node.js, testing with Jest and Express, and GraphQL and writing about these topics here.
